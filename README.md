Setup Instructions
------------------

1. Enable userChrome.css
   - Open Thunderbird  
   - Go to **Settings** > **General**  
   - Click **Config Editor…** under **Advanced**  
   - Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`  
   - Set it to `true`  
   - Restart Thunderbird

2. Enable the Mica flags in Thunderbird’s (Firefox-based) advanced configuration:  
   - Open Thunderbird  
   - Go to **Settings** > **General**  
   - Scroll down and click **Config Editor…** under **Advanced**  
   - In the search bar, type `widget.windows.mica` and set it to `true`  
   - Search for `widget.windows.mica.popups` and set it to `2`

3. Make sure no other theme is selected in Thunderbird settings.
   *Do not* select Light, Dark, or any theme from the Thunderbird extension store.
   The theme must be set to "System Theme" or simply unselected.

4. Copy the included files to the `chrome` folder in your Thunderbird profile directory:
   - Click on Help > Troubleshooting information
   - Scroll down to "Profile Folder" under "Application Basics" and click "Open Folder"
   - Create a new folder named `chrome` inside your profile folder, if it does not already exist
   - Place the userChrome.css file and all folders into the 'chrome' directory
   
5. Restart Thunderbird.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Known Issues
------------
- This is a beta release. Expect bugs and incomplete styling.
- Untested on Mac and Linux (should work, but without Mica).
- Report issues via the GitHub repository.

Also, note that some areas of ThunderBird are rendered outside of the influence of userChrome.css in a "Shadow DOM" - as such, it is not possible to fully theme all elements of Thunderbird.

- The mail section is fully themed, as is the general window chrome. The Contacts, Calendar, Tasks and Chat functions have limited themeing in some areas.
- It isn't possible to style the new message / reply message window, or any other pop-up windows.
- As they are entirely contained within a Shadow DOM, it is also not possible to theme the settings areas.
